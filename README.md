## **You really wanna know? Maybe capture some flags?**

A quiz application built on Django, which was used to conduct HACHE 3.0, a cyber-security event where participants have to capture the flags, which are hidden or encrypted in the assets provided by our cyber-security team.

## How to run this application on your PC ?

The process to do so is very simple. All you have to do is:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your PC. Preferable version : >3.9
2. Clone the repository to a folder of your choice using either `git clone` or `Github Desktop`.
3. After cloning, you have to create a virtual enviroment. I like to call it **env**. You can call it anything you like. You can achieve this by running the following command: `python -m venv env`
   > All the required dependencies will be installed in this **env**.
4. The next step would be to run the virtual environment. You can do so by running the command `./env/scripts/activate`.
5. After the virtual environment starts running, run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt `.
   > This command will install all the required dependencies one by one in your virtual environment.
6. Now, you have to initialize the database. Do so by running `python manage.py makemigrations` and then `python manage.py migrate`.
7. Once the process is complete, your project is ready. Run it by typing `python manaage.py runserver`. It will run the application on `localhost:8000`.
8. You can now open the application which is hosted on `port 8000` on your PC.
